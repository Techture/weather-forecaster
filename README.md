# Weather Forecaster

### What I'm using

- hooks - to manage state
- OpenWeather api - api key is provided for the review, and will be deleted when review is complete
- geolocation api - to get user location and display their weather data
- localStorage - to persist weather data on browser refresh

### Installation

- clone repo
- run npm/yarn install
- run npm/yarn start
