# Weather Forecaster

### What I'm using

- hooks - to manage state
- localStorage - to persist weather data on browser refresh
- OpenWeather api - use the onecall api to get current, hourly, and daily weather data
- get an api key at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up

### Installation

1. clone repo
2. api key will go here >> src/apis/config.js
3. run npm/yarn install
4. run npm/yarn start

### TODO

- add geolocation api - to get user location and display their weather data on start of app
