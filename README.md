# Weather Forecaster

### What I'm using

- hooks - to manage state
- OpenWeather api - you'll need to grab an api key:

1. Register at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
2. Get your unique API key on your personal page

api key will go here >> src/apis/config.js

- localStorage - to persist weather data on browser refresh

### Installation

- clone repo
- run npm/yarn install
- run npm/yarn start

### TODO

- geolocation api - to get user location and display their weather data
